#  Classification with Logistic Regression â€“ Codveda Internship Task

This repository showcases my work on building a **logistic regression classifier** as part of the Codveda Technology internship program. The goal was to classify categorical outcomes using supervised learning techniques.

##  Task Description

**Objective:**  
To implement and evaluate a classification model (Logistic Regression) to predict a categorical target variable using a structured dataset.

##  Key Steps Performed
- Preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled features)
- Built and trained a logistic regression model using **scikit-learn**
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Confusion matrix
  - ROC Curve
- Compared results with other classification models like Random Forest or SVM (optional)

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
